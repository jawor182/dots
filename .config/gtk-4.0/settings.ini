# Theme Name:
# This is the most crucial part. Your 'catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard+default'
# theme MUST have explicit GTK4 support. This means it needs a 'gtk-4.0'
# directory within its theme folder (e.g., /usr/share/themes/catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard+default/gtk-4.0/).
# If it doesn't, GTK4 applications will fall back to Adwaita or look broken.
# If your theme has a GTK4 variant, use its exact name here.
gtk-theme-name=Colloid-Orange-Dark-Gruvbox

# Icon Theme: This should generally work the same as in GTK3.
gtk-icon-theme-name=Papirus-Dark

# Font Name: This should generally work the same as in GTK3.
gtk-font-name=Inter 12

# Cursor Theme: These should generally work the same as in GTK3.
gtk-cursor-theme-name=default
gtk-cursor-theme-size=24

# Toolbar Style, Icon Size, Button/Menu Images:
# These settings are largely deprecated or handled differently in GTK4.
# GTK4's design philosophy moves away from direct user control over these
# specific widget styles, preferring the theme to define them.
# Removing them from settings.ini is usually the best approach.
# If a GTK4 theme supports these, it will apply them internally.
# gtk-toolbar-style=GTK_TOOLBAR_TEXT             # Deprecated/Ignored
# gtk-toolbar-icon-size=GTK_ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR # Deprecated/Ignored
# gtk-button-images=0                            # Deprecated/Ignored
# gtk-menu-images=1                              # Deprecated/Ignored

# Event Sounds: These are typically managed by the desktop environment's sound settings.
# They are less directly configurable via GTK's settings.ini in GTK4.
# gtk-enable-event-sounds=1                      # Less direct control
# gtk-enable-input-feedback-sounds=0             # Less direct control

# Font Rendering (Xft settings): These generally still apply for Xorg.
gtk-xft-antialias=1
gtk-xft-hinting=1
gtk-xft-hintstyle=hintfull
gtk-xft-rgba=rgb

# Dark Theme Preference: This has changed significantly for libadwaita applications.
# For libadwaita apps, the preferred way is to set the color-scheme.
# Add this section for libadwaita applications to prefer dark mode:

color-scheme=prefer-dark
